### TyTorch and SciKet-Learn implementation with Streamlit 
PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning framework used for building and training deep neural networks. (https://pytorch.org)

Scikit-learn is a ML lib for Python. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
It is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy. (https://scikit-learn.org)

### Thrombin_IC50 is the IC50 of inhibitory activity against human thrombin CHEMBL204 are from ChEMBL with the following query:
activities = activity.filter(target_chembl_id="CHEMBL204").filter(standard_type='IC50').filter(standard_relation='=')
            .only(['molecule_chembl_id', 'canonical_smiles', 'standard_value', 'standard_units'])

### Deployment
It is deployed on Streamlit community cloud:
